HackRPI - First Place Mobile Application Category Winner - 11/16/2014 

Description: 
Okiru is Japanese for "to get up", and this hack is a love letter to all hackers who struggle to wake up in the morning. 
Okiru features Microsoft Azure cloud hosting, voice recognition, Venmo payment api implementation, and cron scheduling. 
After authorizing yourself with Venmo and scheduling your alarm(s), Okiru will give you a wake up call at your desired times. 
You will be prompted to listen to a short story, for which afterwards you will be asked to answer a question. 
If you fail to answer the question correctly you will be penalized with a $1 charge on Venmo, then Okiru will hang up and call you back If you dare to oversleep.
